## psychProbing

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Probing the contents of semantic representations from text, behavior, and brain data using the psychNorms metabase"

### Environment setup

1. To set up a conda environment, you can use the `environment.yml` file in the root directory of this repository. 
2. **Before running any other code, make sure to run `code/setup.py` to download/generate the necessary data files. Please note that
to reduce the download size of the representations, we have already subsetted them to their intersection with the psychNorms dataset.**
3. For licensing reasons, you will need to manually download `SWOW-EN18 [80Mb]`, unzip it, and move `SWOW-EN.R100.20180827.csv` into `data/free_assoc/` from the [Small World of Words](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/research).
4. To obtain the representations that we trained ourselves, you will need to run the notebooks in `code/1_embed_training/`. 
5. Analyses (`code/2_rsa` and `code/3_rca`) can then be run in the order implied by the numbering.
6. Finally, figures can be generated by running the notebooks in `code/figures/`.

### Representations

       'RW2034', 'WordSim353', 'Zie25', 'Zie30' (datasets were combined, min-max scaled and then processed with SVD transformation).

Note: `compo_attribs` has been renamed to 'experiential attributes' in the paper and figures to be consistent with the terminolgy in the psychNorms metabase.
